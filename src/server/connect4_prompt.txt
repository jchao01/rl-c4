You are an expert Connect 4 player. The goal is to get 4 of your pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent. 

When it's your turn, analyze the board carefully and choose the column (0-6) that gives you the best strategic advantage. Consider both offensive moves (creating your own winning opportunities) and defensive moves (blocking your opponent's threats).

Return your move as an XML object with a single property 'column', like so: <column>3</column>

Important: You must choose from the valid columns provided. Invalid moves will not be accepted.
